"""
Example Script for Pulling NBA Data Using nba_api

This script demonstrates how to use two different kinds of endpoints:

1. NBA Live Data:
   - Live Scoreboard: Retrieves game data from NBA.com in real time.
2. NBA Official Stats:
   - Player Career Stats: Example for Nikola Jokić (player_id '203999').
   - League Leaders: Retrieve season leader statistics.
   - League Game Log: Retrieves game log data for a given season.

The script prints some of the first few rows of each returned DataFrame,
and for the player career stats it also shows how to fetch a JSON snippet.

Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed.
